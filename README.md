# KOIN Recode Project

KOIN is service for [KOREATECH](https://www.koreatech.ac.kr/) students.

## Purpose

KOREATECH Univ. is located in an area away from the city center called Byeongcheon-myeon.

So it is not possible to use services designed around the city center with many students.

Now, We made a service for students.
